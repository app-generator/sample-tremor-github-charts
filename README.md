## What is [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/)

Tremor is a low-level, opinionated UI component library to build dashboards. It offers components, such as charts, layouts, or input elements, covering the essential parts of a dashboard or analytical interface.

Their approach provides flexibility between beautiful defaults and fast customization. The best way to get started is to check out our templates, called Blocks, for getting a feeling of how components are used and combined.
